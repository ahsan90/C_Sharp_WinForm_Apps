Create a Windows Forms project that will allow theuserto select one of the two discount rates or none, and then the services.The interface you are to replicate is found on the second page of this document.

Calculate the total due for all services.  A client may purchase several services in a single visit, essentially one screen input is purchasing one service.(When CLEAR is clicked that person’s transaction is ended.)If no service is selected the user must be prompted with an error message.The use of selection structure is what is expected to achieve the above.

Button functionality requirements are as follow:

➢Calculate ~ Calculatethe service price and the running total for all services.  The results are not displayed only calculated here.  To see them you must use the Display button.\
➢Clear ~ all input and output fields, as well as returns you to the starting point of the interface.\
➢Display~ Display using a MessageBox object, the services selected and the total costfor one clientvia a summary message.  Do not recalculate simply use the results from the Calculate button.\
➢Exit ~  Close the program down
