Problem:\
Create a base class for a banking account. Decide what characteristics are common for checking and saving accounts and include these characteristics in the base class. Define subclasses for checking and savings. In your design, do not allow the banking base account to be instantiatedâ€”only the checking and saving subclasses. Include a presentation class to test your design.

Solution Approach:\
The solution is based on Inheritance which one of the OOP features. Logic are kept separated by utilizing extended class called form validation which only performs validation for each form input and generate respective error message. This solution mostly focuses on demonstrating inheritance regardless any kind of logical operation using windows form application.
